                        The boat in the painting signifies the impact of the Columbian exchange on Italy’s foodscape. As
                        explained by Nunn and Qian, the Columbian exchange was “the exchange of diseases, ideas, food,
                        crops and populations between the New World and the Old world.”<sup>[<a
                                href="#bibliography">1</a>]</sup> The Old World referring to
                        Eastern Hemisphere, namely Europe, and the New World referring to the Americas. The Columbian
                        exchange brought many new crops to Europe, including maize, potatoes, sweet potatoes, tomatoes,
                        cassava, cacao beans, pineapples, chili peppers and tobacco.<sup>[<a
                                href="#bibliography">2</a>]</sup> Though the Columbian exchange
                        brought many new crops between the ‘Old world’ and the ‘New,’ it was also devastating for the
                        indigenous people of the Americas due to diseases and colonisation, and was the driving force
                        behind American chattel slavery.

                        These plates made by Theodor de Bry depict the food and farming of Native Americans. The plates
                        portray the native Americans as having an abundance of food and shows their farming technique.
                        The portrayal is glamourised, with the interactions between the Native Americans and the Spanish
                        with the native American women being depicted as venus-esque with long flowing hair. The text,
                        translated by google, describes the second voyage to the Americas, whereupon the voyagers were
                        met by a Native American King, who bestowed them gifts and indicated “every kind of display of
                        civility.”<sup>[<a href="#bibliography">5</a>]</sup> This account and the nature of the images

                        <div class="text-block">
                            The tomato appears in the painting as an example of the impact of food from the Americas on
                            Italian cuisine. Though other influential foods such as the potato and eggplant came to
                            Europe had massive impacts, for Italian cuisine, none were so influential as the Tomato. The
                            focus on the tomato in my research is partly due to its symbolism in representing all foods
                            brought by the Columbian Exchange, but mostly it is to highlight the tremendous impact that
                            one element can have on an entire culture. The tomato is synonymous with Italian food
                            throughout the world today, and its journey onto the plate of Italy is intrinsically linked
                            with the evolution of Italian cuisine into what it is today.

                        <div class="text-block">Though the tomato was known to be in Italy as early as 1548, it wasn’t
                            widely consumed for around three hundred years after its initial debut.<sup>[<a
                                    href="#bibliography">8</a>]</sup> One reason the
                            tomato did not catch on in popularity is its association with the belladonna plant, with
                            people believing it to be poisonous. Tomatoes were described by Pietro Antonio Michiel, a
                            1500s Venetian botanist as “dangerous and harmful” and causing “eye diseases and headaches”
                            and was “thought to have potent magical and hallucinatory powers.”<sup>[<a
                                    href="#bibliography">9</a>]</sup> Vegetables in general
                            were seen with distrust at this time in Italy, they “were always vilified, as they got
                            trapped in the body’s membranes and putrefied.”<sup>[<a href="#bibliography">10</a>]</sup>
                            The tomato slowly grew in popularity, with
                            it appearing in a 1759 survey as “among the fruits prized by men as foodstuffs or as
                            condiments.”<sup>[<a href="#bibliography">11</a>]</sup> Though the tomato gained traction,
                            it stayed mostly rural at the time, by the
                            1790s, the tomato was localised to mostly southern coastal areas and the islands Sardinia
                            and Sicily, which had Spanish influence, as Spain more readily adopted the tomato into their
                            cuisine.<sup>[<a href="#bibliography">12</a>]</sup> By the early 1800s, however tomatoes had
                            spread in popularity to be “cultivated in
                            all market and kitchen gardens.”<sup>[<a href="#bibliography">13</a>]</sup> Thus, tomatoes
                            came to be one of the most influential and
                            pivotal foods in Italian cuisine. Their journey showcases the immense amount of change that
                            Italy underwent in both culture and cuisine.

                        species from the Columbian exchange, with

                        likely the first place for Tomatoes to be
                        grown in Italy, and this, along with the other American plants, make the garden an extremely
                        important place for the evolution of Italian food through the infusion of crops from the ‘New
                        World’.

                            The bowl of pasta is included to celebrate Italy’s most ubiquitous dish. The red tomato
                            sauce further establishes the bond between tomatoes and Italian cuisine and shows how
                            something can grow in cultural significance. Pasta with a sauce of tomatoes can be seen as
                            early as 1880s Naples, where “for those who could afford it, tomatoes […] form the customary
                            seasoning for macaroni, and not a day goes by when they don’t appear on the table of the
                            middle class.”<sup>[<a href="#bibliography">19</a>]</sup> Pasta became a main feature of
                            Italian cuisine in the middle ages and “has
                            emerged as the symbol of Italian culinary genius […] both in its national identity and in
                            its regional diversity.”2 Therefore, displaying pasta, particularly with the now standard
                            tomato sauce, accentuates the<sup>[<a href="#bibliography">20</a>]</sup> significance of the
                            dish in Italian cuisine, as well as its
                            history and its adaptability, with all Italian regions having their own interpretation of
                            the fundamental dish.

                    <div class="text-block">
                        The purpose of this project is to look at how a cuisine transforms and evolves. Though,
                        naturally, any and all culture will organically change and evolve over time; this project is
                        particularly interested in the dramatic overturn of Italian cuisine that happened from the
                        introduction of foods from the ‘New World’ to the time of unification and the political
                        ramifications of a unified cuisine. First, it was discussed how the tomato and its journey from
                        the Americas symbolised a great time of change and a pivotal introduction of what is now a
                        staple of Italian food. Now, we shall discuss the impact of literature on Italian cuisine; how
                        codifying and memorialising something as intangible and regional as an ever evolving and ever
                        changing fare of food elevates it into a cultural consciousness. The act of creating a cookbook
                        solidifies cuisine at that point in time and prepares the foundation for the next step. This
                        brings us to Antonio Latini. Latini was a cook, steward, banquet manager and author.<sup>[<a
                                href="#bibliography">22</a>]</sup> Published
                        in 1692-1694, Latini’s book “Lo Scalco Alla Moderna” (The Modern Steward), is particularly
                        notable as it marks the transition of Italian food from “the earlier courtly style Italian
                        cooking to the new French style that came to dominate European cooking during the eighteenth
                        century.”<sup>[<a href="#bibliography">23</a>]</sup> Latini’s focus on “local ingredients and
                        local practices” as well as “his attempt to
                        join local styles with international traditions,”<sup>[<a href="#bibliography">24</a>]</sup>
                        shows that though the French influence was
                        accelerating in the upper class Italian foodscape, a cuisine of its own was beginning to emerge
                        and be recorded.

                            Corrado.
                            Corrado first published his cookbook “Il Cuoco Galante” (The Gallant Cook) in 1773.
                            Corrado’s
                            cookbook was very successful and influential, having ten editions published from 1773 to
                            1830.<sup>[<a href="#bibliography">26</a>]</sup>
                            In
                            Corrado’s cookbook, he speaks about his desire to instil a more refined and Italian way of
                            cooking,
                            and of how the Italian cuisine has been subsumed by influence from foreign lands. He credits
                            Antonio
                            Latini with trying to establish a more elegant cuisine with his book, though remarks on how
                            Italian
                            cuisine is still lacking elegance, delicacy and good taste. He writes “In recent times,
                            there
                            were
                            some Italians who, disgusted by antiquity on this subject, tried to replace the old with a
                            new,
                            more
                            gentle and convincing [cuisine], in the matter of preparation and seasoning.”<sup>[<a href="#bibliography">27</a>]</sup> He also
                            speaks
                            most
                            concernedly of Naples, where both he and Latini primarily resided. This ambition to
                            establish a
                            more
                            refined and Italian cuisine in both Naples and wider Italy, shows the drive to a more
                            unified
                            and
                            culturally rich cuisine, rather than one overly influenced by foreign cultures.

                        The map of Italy with the clear divide between north and south represents the strong cultural,
                        linguistic, financial and political divide between north and south Italy both at the time being
                        discussed, but also through to present day. These divides between regions are important to
                        discuss as, particularly due to cultural and linguistic divides, Italian cuisine was, for a long
                        time, fragmented and somewhat isolated. As the goal of this project is to explore how major
                        political and cultural events impact cuisine and vice versa, the fragmentation of Italy and the
                        subsequent fragmentation of cuisine is pivotal in this discussion. The divide between north and
                        south Italy is self-evident, as stated by Huysseune “it would be absurd to deny regional
                        differences within Italy, and the deep roots these differences have in history.”<sup>[<a href="#bibliography">29</a>]</sup> The divide
                        between north and south is certainly cultural, though more measurably, economic and political,
                        Missiaia writes “Italy has been characterised, throughout its unitary history, by large regional
                        differentials in income, level of industrialization, and development.”<sup>[<a href="#bibliography">30</a>]</sup> The link between food
                        and territory is discussed by Hibberd, who argues that “the rise of nationalist sentiment led to
                        the formation of an Italian food culture.”<sup>[<a href="#bibliography">31</a>]</sup> Hibberd discusses the specific differences between
                        the north and south cuisines, noting how “the south relies upon dried pasta whereas many of the
                        famous dishes of the centre use fresh [and] in the north, rice and polenta have tended to serve
                        the staple function taken be pasta across the rest of the country.”<sup>[<a href="#bibliography">32</a>]</sup> Hibberd also speaks about
                        how the reality of a multi-faceted, multi-cultural Italian cuisine is contrasted by the global
                        understanding of a more unified exported cultural image, stating “Italian national cuisine sits
                        rather uneasily between global versions of popular Italian dishes and more autonomist demands
                        that place emphasis on regional or local cuisines.”<sup>[<a href="#bibliography">33</a>]</sup> Therefore, though this project discusses
                        Italian cuisine holistically, looking at great movements, impacts, and consolidations, regional
                        differences must be acknowledged, as well as how economic, political and linguistic differences
                        play a role in the variation in Italian cuisine. However, this project is concerned not only
                        with the political and cultural impact upon food, but the impact of food on the political and
                        cultural. This brings us to our next segment, Pellegrino Artusi and Unification through food.

                        The third cookbook in the painting represents “La scienza in cucina e l’arte di mangiar bene”
                        (Science in the kitchen and the art of eating well) first published in 1891 By Pellegrino
                        Artusi. Artusi is an important figure to discuss for this subject as his work was explicitly in
                        service of the development of a national identity through cuisine. Following the Italian
                        unification, or “Il Risorgimento” of 1861, Italy experienced many social and political problems.
                        Helstosky writes “the 1890s in Italy were a decade of political conflict, food riots, the
                        founding of the Italian Socialist Party and the first year of industrialisation.”<sup>[<a href="#bibliography">36</a>]</sup> A large
                        problem with burgeoning Italy was facing was a distinct lack of a common cultural identity. One
                        of the most pivotal elements of this problem was the linguistic barriers of the time, as at the
                        time of unification “less than 10% of the Italian population could speak the national language”<sup>[<a href="#bibliography">37</a>]</sup>
                        The inability for effective communication between regions hampered the emergence of a national
                        identity and, consequently, a national cuisine. Pellegrino Artusi was a nationalist and
                        “advocated a national homogenisation of existing food habits.”<sup>[<a href="#bibliography">38</a>]</sup> His book, ‘science in the
                        kitchen’ was written to “bring Italians together through food consumption” and to “complem[ent]
                        and bolst[er] the efforts of the Italian government to bring together disparate populations of
                        citizens at a difficult time.”<sup>[<a href="#bibliography">39</a>]</sup>

                    <div class="text-block">
                        Through his book, Pellegrino provided “a common language about the kinds of foods available in
                        Italy and the ways in which Italians prepared them”<sup>[<a href="#bibliography">40</a>]</sup> Artusi did this by weaving together
                        traditional Italian with vernacular elements, giving people a practical language through which
                        to discuss food. Artusi “wanted to be understood by all Italians [and] to provide a kind of
                        paternal mediation between Italian and various dialect traditions.”<sup>[<a href="#bibliography">41</a>]</sup> ‘La scienza in cucina’
                        “brought together and codified many dishes from the Italian peninsula, turning those dishes into
                        a template of Italian national identity.”<sup>[<a href="#bibliography">42</a>]</sup> Artusi expressed his wish for his book to be
                        accessible to all Italians, stating “with my manual, [..] one need only know how to hold a
                        wooden spoon to work something out,”<sup>[<a href="#bibliography">43</a>]</sup> and expressing that “it is not for money, nor the pursuit
                        of honor in an art that the unjust world wishes to appear to revile, but in the conviction that
                        I am doing something useful for the public, that I now reprint.”<sup>[<a href="#bibliography">44</a>]</sup> It is also clear in his book
                        how Artusi wished to honour the differences between regions while bringing them together, often
                        comparing the techniques of different regions.<sup>[<a href="#bibliography">45</a>]</sup> When first published, ‘La scienza in cucina,’
                        contained 475 recipes. However, by 1910, and its fourteenth edition, the book had 773 recipes,
                        due to readers who had “mailed recipes and suggestions to Artusi, who added them to the
                        collection.”<sup>[<a href="#bibliography">46</a>]</sup> This shows Artusi’s dedication to making his tome as comprehensive and reflective
                        of regional and diverse Italian cuisine as possible, “the exchange of letters and the recipes
                        [were] sent to Artusi from every city in Italy.”<sup>[<a href="#bibliography">47</a>]</sup> Thus, a national culinary identity was
                        constructed within ‘La scienza in cucina,’ and Italians were given the linguistic tools and
                        exposure necessary to begin to organically coalesce disparate regional fare into a cohesive
                        Italian cuisine, with Artusi’s “work […] now considered the canon for Italy.”<sup>[<a href="#bibliography">48</a>]</sup>
