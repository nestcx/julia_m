                        The boat in the painting signifies the impact of the Columbian exchange on Italy’s foodscape. As
                        explained by Nunn and Qian, the Columbian exchange was “the exchange of diseases, ideas, food,
                        crops and populations between the New World and the Old world.”<sup>[3]</sup> The Old World
                        referring to Eastern Hemisphere, namely Europe, and the New World referring to the Americas. The
                        Columbian exchange brought many new crops to Europe, including maize, potatoes, sweet potatoes,
                        tomatoes, cassava, cacao beans, pineapples, chili peppers and tobacco.<sup>[4]</sup> Though the
                        Columbian exchange brought many new crops between the ‘Old world’ and the ‘New,’ it was also
                        devastating for the indigenous people of the Americas due to diseases and colonisation, and was
                        the driving force behind American chattel slavery.<sup>[5]</sup>

                        These plates made by Theodor de Bry depict the food and farming of Native Americans. The plates
                        portray the native Americans as having an abundance of food and shows their farming technique.
                        The portrayal is glamourised, with the interactions between the Native Americans and the Spanish
                        with the Native American women being depicted as venus-esque with long flowing hair. The text,
                        translated by google, describes the second voyage to the Americas, whereupon the voyagers were
                        met by a Native American King, who bestowed them gifts and indicated “every kind of display of
                        civility.”<sup>[7]</sup> This account and the nature of the images casts the Columbian exchange
                        in the light of a mutual, friendly exchange of goods, rather than a catalyst of disease,
                        genocide and slavery, with an estimated decrease of 80-95% of the Native American population
                        within 150 years of 1492.<sup>[8]</sup> In this codex by Agostino Aglio, the prominence of Maize
                        in the Native American culture is highlighted, showing the importance of the Maize crop.

                        <div class="text-block">
                            The tomato appears in the painting as an example of the impact of food from the Americas on
                            Italian cuisine. Though other influential foods such as the potato and eggplant came to
                            Europe had massive impacts, for Italian cuisine, none were so influential as the Tomato. The
                            focus on the tomato in my research is partly due to its symbolism in representing all foods
                            brought by the Columbian Exchange, but mostly it is to highlight the tremendous impact that
                            one element can have on an entire culture. The tomato is synonymous with Italian food
                            throughout the world today, and its journey onto the plate of Italy is intrinsically linked
                            with the evolution of Italian cuisine into what it is today.

                        <div class="text-block">Though the tomato was known to be in Italy as early as 1548, it was not
                            widely consumed for around three hundred years after its initial debut.<sup>[10]</sup> One
                            reason the tomato did not catch on in popularity is its association with the belladonna
                            plant, with people believing it to be poisonous. Tomatoes were described by Pietro Antonio
                            Michiel, a 1500s Venetian botanist as “dangerous and harmful” and causing “eye diseases and
                            headaches” and was “thought to have potent magical and hallucinatory powers.”<sup>[11]</sup>
                            Vegetables in general were seen with distrust at this time in Italy, they “were always
                            vilified, as they got trapped in the body’s membranes and putrefied.”<sup>[12]</sup>
                        </div>
                        <div class="para-break"></div>
                        <div class="text-block">
                            The tomato slowly grew in popularity, with it appearing in a 1759 survey as “among the
                            fruits prized by men as foodstuffs or as condiments.”<sup>[13]</sup> Though the tomato
                            gained traction, it stayed mostly rural at the time. In the 1790s, the tomato was localised
                            to mostly southern coastal areas and the islands Sardinia and Sicily, which had Spanish
                            influence, as Spain more readily adopted the tomato into their cuisine.<sup>[14]</sup> By
                            the early 1800s, however tomatoes had spread in popularity to be “cultivated in all market
                            and kitchen gardens.”<sup>[15]</sup> Thus, tomatoes came to be one of the most influential
                            and pivotal foods in Italian cuisine. Their journey showcases the immense amount of change
                            that Italy underwent in both culture and cuisine.

                        by Botanist Luca Ghini and supported by Cosimo I de Medici.<sup>[16]</sup> It is the first place
                        the Tomato was recorded to be in Italy in October 1548.<sup>[17]</sup> Medici was presented a
                        basket of “pomidoro” that had been sent to him. It was “the first time the strange new fruit was
                        given a name, anywhere in Europe.”<sup>[18]</sup> The gardens were also used to grow many new
                        species from the Columbian exchange, with “Cosimo attempt[ing] to import and acclimatize various
                        American Plants,”<sup>[19]</sup> and “Ghini enrich[ing] the garden with exotic
                        species.”<sup>[20]</sup> The gardens are likely the first place for Tomatoes to be grown in
                        Italy, and this, along with the other American plants, make the garden an extremely important
                        place for the evolution of Italian food through the infusion of crops from the ‘New World’.

                            The bowl of pasta is included to celebrate Italy’s most ubiquitous dish. The red tomato
                            sauce
                            further establishes the bond between tomatoes and Italian cuisine and shows how something
                            can
                            grow in cultural significance. Pasta with a sauce of tomatoes can be seen as early as 1880s
                            Naples, where “for those who could afford it, tomatoes […] form the customary seasoning for
                            macaroni, and not a day goes by when they do not appear on the table of the middle
                            class.”<sup>[21]</sup> Pasta became a main feature of Italian cuisine in the middle ages and
                            “has emerged as the symbol of Italian culinary genius […] both in its national identity and
                            in
                            its regional diversity.”<sup>[22]</sup> Therefore, displaying pasta, particularly with the
                            now
                            standard tomato sauce, accentuates the significance of the dish in Italian cuisine, as well
                            as
                            its history and its adaptability, with all Italian regions having their own interpretation
                            of
                            the fundamental dish.

                        The purpose of this project is to look at how a cuisine transforms and evolves. Though,
                        naturally, any and all culture will organically change and evolve over time; this project is
                        particularly interested in the dramatic overturn of Italian cuisine that happened from the
                        introduction of foods from the ‘New World’ to the time of unification and the political
                        ramifications of a unified cuisine. First, it was discussed how the tomato and its journey
                        from
                        the Americas symbolised a great time of change and a pivotal introduction of what is now a
                        staple of Italian food. Now, we shall discuss the impact of literature on Italian cuisine;
                        how
                        codifying and memorialising something as intangible and regional as an ever-evolving fare of
                        food, elevates it into a shared cultural consciousness. The act of creating a cookbook
                        solidifies cuisine at that point in time and prepares the foundation for the next step.

                        This brings us to Antonio Latini. Latini was a cook, steward, banquet manager, and
                        author.<sup>[23]</sup>
                        Published in 1692-1694, Latini’s book Lo Scalco Alla Moderna (The Modern Steward), is
                        particularly notable as it marks the transition of Italian food from “the earlier courtly
                        style
                        Italian cooking to the new French style that came to dominate European cooking during the
                        eighteenth century.”<sup>[24]</sup> Latini’s focus on “local ingredients and local
                        practices” as
                        well as “his
                        attempt to join local styles with international traditions,”<sup>[25]</sup> shows that
                        though
                        the French
                        influence was accelerating in the upper class Italian foodscape, a cuisine of its own was
                        beginning to emerge and be recorded.

                            The second cookbook displayed in the painting is representative of the works of Vincenzo
                            Corrado. Corrado first published his cookbook <i>Il Cuoco Galante</i> (The Gallant Cook)
                            in
                            1773.
                            Corrado’s cookbook was very successful and influential, having ten editions published
                            from
                            1773 to 1830.<sup>[27]</sup> In Corrado’s cookbook, he speaks about his desire to instil
                            a
                            more refined
                            and Italian way of cooking, and of how the Italian cuisine has been subsumed by
                            influence
                            from foreign lands. He credits Antonio Latini with trying to establish a more elegant
                            cuisine with his book, though remarks on how Italian cuisine is still lacking elegance,
                            delicacy and good taste. He writes “In recent times, there were some Italians who,
                            disgusted
                            by antiquity on this subject, tried to replace the old with a new, more gentle and
                            convincing [cuisine], in the matter of preparation and seasoning.”<sup>[28]</sup> He
                            also
                            speaks most
                            concernedly of Naples, where both he and Latini primarily resided. This ambition to
                            establish a more refined and Italian cuisine in both Naples and wider Italy, shows the
                            drive
                            to a more unified and culturally rich cuisine, rather than one overly influenced by
                            foreign
                            cultures.

                        linguistic, financial and political divide between north and south Italy both at the time
                        being
                        discussed and through to present day. These divides between regions are important to discuss
                        as
                        particularly due to cultural and linguistic divides, Italian cuisine was for a long time,
                        fragmented and somewhat isolated. As the goal of this project is to explore how major
                        political
                        and cultural events impact cuisine and vice versa, the fragmentation of Italy and the
                        subsequent
                        fragmentation of cuisine is pivotal in this discussion.

                        The divide between north and south Italy is self-evident, as stated by Huysseune “it would
                        be
                        absurd to deny regional differences within Italy, and the deep roots these differences have
                        in
                        history.”<sup>[31]</sup> The divide between north and south is certainly cultural, though
                        more
                        measurably, economic and political. Missiaia writes “Italy has been characterised,
                        throughout
                        its unitary history, by large regional differentials in income, level of industrialization,
                        and
                        development.”<sup>[32]</sup> The link between food and territory is discussed by Hibberd,
                        who
                        argues that “the rise of nationalist sentiment led to the formation of an Italian food
                        culture.”<sup>[33]</sup> Hibberd discusses the specific differences between the north and
                        south
                        cuisines, noting how “the south relies upon dried pasta whereas many of the famous dishes of
                        the
                        centre use fresh [and] in the north, rice and polenta have tended to serve the staple
                        function
                        taken be pasta across the rest of the country.”<sup>[34]</sup> Hibberd also speaks about how
                        the
                        reality of a multi-faceted, multi-cultural Italian cuisine is contrasted by the global
                        understanding of a more unified exported cultural image, stating “Italian national cuisine
                        sits
                        rather uneasily between global versions of popular Italian dishes and more autonomist
                        demands
                        that place emphasis on regional or local cuisines.”<sup>[35]</sup> Therefore, though this
                        project discusses Italian cuisine holistically, looking at great movements, impacts, and
                        consolidations, regional differences must be acknowledged, as well as how economic,
                        political
                        and linguistic differences play a role in the variation in Italian cuisine. However, this
                        project is concerned not only with the political and cultural impact upon food, but the
                        impact
                        of food on the political and cultural. This brings us to our next segment, Pellegrino Artusi
                        and
                        Unification through food.

                    <div class="para-h2">The Third Book</div>
                    <div class="text-block">
                        The third cookbook in the painting represents La scienza in cucina e l’arte di mangiar bene
                        (Science in the kitchen and the art of eating well) first published in 1891 By Pellegrino
                        Artusi. Artusi is an important figure to discuss for this subject as his work was explicitly
                        in
                        service of the development of a national identity through cuisine. Following the Italian
                        unification, or “Il Risorgimento” of 1861, Italy experienced many social and political
                        problems.
                        Helstosky writes “the 1890s in Italy were a decade of political conflict, food riots, the
                        founding of the Italian Socialist Party and the first year of
                        industrialisation.”<sup>[38]</sup>
                        A large problem with burgeoning Italy was facing was a distinct lack of a common cultural
                        identity. One of the most pivotal elements of this problem was the linguistic barriers of
                        the
                        time, as at the time of unification “less than 10% of the Italian population could speak the
                        national language”.<sup>[39]</sup> The inability for effective communication between regions
                        hampered the emergence of a national identity and, consequently, a national cuisine.
                        Pellegrino
                        Artusi was a nationalist and “advocated a national homogenisation of existing food
                        habits.”<sup>[40]</sup> His book, ‘Science in the Kitchen’ was written to “bring Italians
                        together through food consumption” and to “complem[ent] and bolst[er] the efforts of the
                        Italian
                        government to bring together disparate populations of citizens at a difficult
                        time.”<sup>[41]</sup>
                    </div>
                    <div class="para-break"></div>
                    <div class="text-block">
                        Through his book, Pellegrino provided “a common language about the kinds of foods available
                        in
                        Italy and the ways in which Italians prepared them”<sup>42</sup> Artusi did this by weaving
                        together traditional Italian with vernacular elements, giving people a practical language
                        through which to discuss food. Artusi “wanted to be understood by all Italians [and] to
                        provide
                        a kind of paternal mediation between Italian and various dialect traditions.”<sup>43</sup>
                        La
                        scienza in cucina “brought together and codified many dishes from the Italian peninsula,
                        turning
                        those dishes into a template of Italian national identity.”<sup>44</sup> Artusi expressed
                        his
                        wish for his book to be accessible to all Italians, stating “with my manual, [..] one need
                        only
                        know how to hold a wooden spoon to work something out,”<sup>45</sup> and expressing that “it
                        is
                        not for money, nor the pursuit of honor in an art that the unjust world wishes to appear to
                        revile, but in the conviction that I am doing something useful for the public, that I now
                        reprint.”<sup>46</sup> It is also clear in his book how Artusi wished to honour the
                        differences
                        between regions while bringing them together, often comparing the techniques of different
                        regions.<sup>47</sup> When first published, La scienza in cucina, contained 475 recipes.
                        However, by 1910, and its fourteenth edition, the book had 773 recipes, due to readers who
                        had
                        “mailed recipes and suggestions to Artusi, who added them to the collection.”<sup>48</sup>
                        This
                        shows Artusi’s dedication to making his tome as comprehensive and reflective of regional and
                        diverse Italian cuisine as possible, “the exchange of letters and the recipes [were] sent to
                        Artusi from every city in Italy.”<sup>49</sup> Thus, a national culinary identity was
                        constructed within La scienza in cucina, and Italians were given the linguistic tools and
                        exposure necessary to begin to organically coalesce disparate regional fare into a cohesive
                        Italian cuisine, with Artusi’s “work […] now considered the canon for Italy.”<sup>50</sup>
