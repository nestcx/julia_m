                The cuisine of Italy is one of the most known and beloved around the world. It is viewed as a cohesive,
                almost homogenous entity, complete with rules, and Nonnas instructing you that this sauce accompanies
                this pasta and pineapple does not go on pizza. One would think such a rich and adored cuisine would be
                as established and old as Rome itself. However, this is not the case. For much of history, Italian food
                was seen as meagre and regional divides meant a distinct lack of organic culinary unity.<sup>[1]</sup> It was not
                until the Columbian exchange that many of the quintessential Italian ingredients were even introduced to
                Italy. Further still, due to the unbridgeable differences in dialect, common Italians did not have the
                means to communicate sufficiently in order to share their culinary knowledge. This did not improve until
                after Unification in 1861 and a concerted movement to encourage widespread use of traditional Italian.

            <div class="text-block">It is this period of change that this project wishes to focus on; the evolution and
                coalescence of Italian food from limited, unconnected regional fare to one of the world’s favourite
                cuisines. This project is presented in the form of a painting, highlighting key elements which
                contributed to the evolution of the Italian foodscape. The painting will be complete with a key so that
                the audience may peruse the significance of each element and how it contributes to the wider picture of
                Italian cuisine. The painting itself is of a landscape, as a nod to ‘foodscape’ and features a picnic,
                showing that food is “to be enjoyed.”<sup>[2]</sup> The elements discussed fall within the time period between the
                beginning of the Columbian exchange and the beginning of the twentieth century. This project stops at
                the twentieth century as the changes undergone from 1900s onwards deal more with the export of Italian
                cuisine to the rest of the world through immigration due to political upheaval and war. This project
                desires to focus more on the internal struggle and evolution that Italian cuisine faced previous to its
                global popularisation. The project also tackles the political events which enacted upon the development
                of cuisine, highlighting the intersection of important historical and political movements with the
                expansion of culture. It also interrogates to what extent a national cuisine can be organically reached
                through cultural and regional integration, and concludes that, though culture will inevitably develop
                organically, external acting forces must provoke great leaps forward.
