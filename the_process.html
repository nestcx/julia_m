                In this section I will talk about the process of creating the painting, and how I went about showcasing
                historical imagery in my work. I will also include my reflection at the end.

            <div class="text-block">First, I decided what I wanted to discuss in my project and what imagery would
                represent each point of discussion. I played around with sketches to block in my painting and test out
                different ideas.

                        at Anchor” 1628 by Andries Van Eertvelt. The Santa Maria is the ship which Christopher Columbus
                        used to sail to the Americas. I used this image to represent the Columbian Exchange and the
                        subsequent effect on Italian cuisine. </div>

                    <div class="para-h2">The Tomato</div>
                    <div class="text-block">When designing the tomato I wanted to represent all of the foods brought to
                        Italy by the Columbian Exchange. The basket itself is based largely on this image, taken from a
                        plate by Theordor de Bry. It is representing an offering that the Native Americans made to the
                        explorers who came to their lands. I wished to emulate the sense of abundance and show that,
                        though these fruits and vegetables were a gift to Italy, they were taken from Native Americans
                        and are representative of countless deaths and imperialist theft.

                <div class="text-block">
                    When designing the fruit, I looked to the works of Giorgio Bonelli, an eighteenth-century botanist
                    and Illustrator. His work Hortus Romanus, 1772 was used for reference as he drew many of the plants
                    brought in by the Columbian exchange. This pineapple and tomato are examples of his work and were
                    used in the design of the painting.

                        The feeling of joyously eating pasta was something I wished to capture.

            <div class="text-block">When designing the map in the painting, these two maps were used. The first
                map is from 1838, pre-unification, and clearly shows the division between regions, particularly
                north and south. The second map is from 1882, post-unification, and shows Italy as it is now.
                Both maps were used to create my map, representing Italy both as it now is, but still with north
                and south divided.

                wrote the names of Latini and Corrado on the spines to identify them. The Artusi cookbook is shown open,

            <div class="divider"></div>
            <div class="para-h2">Reflection</div>
            <div class="text-block">
                My chosen topic of Italy’s foodscape was of great interest to me, and I was very passionate about the
                subject matter. The idea of cultural development, and particularly culinary development is something I
                have a strong pull towards as I love to cook (and eat). I was also very interested in exploring cultural
                development as intersected with social and political movements and events. The impact of external
                national changes is reflected in all elements of cultural expression, though I believe food to be the
                most representative as it is the most accessible. It is also one which forms the nucleus of both the
                house and the family, and centres women, which many cultural pursuits at the time did not. The thesis of
                the project is that culture, while organically developing, often requires an external or intentional
                push in order to undergo significant revolution. This is explored through the Columbian exchange and
                individual actors who felt compelled to seek out and formulate a national culinary identity through
                literature. The medium chosen was a painting, which was very enjoyable for me as I love to paint and was
                able to visually represent the Italian foodscape while interweaving the discussed elements into a
                cohesive whole.
            </div>
            <div class="para-break"></div>
            <div class="text-block">The biggest challenge regarding this topic was the selection and construction of
                many different subjects into one narrative. I am aware that my topic is quite broad temporally and
                source wise, so I made a concerted effort for it to be focussed in narrative and aim. It was also
                challenging to find good primary sources with which to work, as I was focussing on the history of a
                foreign country and thus did not have access to in person archives. In order to overcome this, I
                focussed my source pool on art and literature of the time, using images to inform my analysis and books
                which were contemporary to my topic to explore cultural culinary attitudes of the time. Therefore, my
                project has a strong emphasis on cookbooks, which I feel are the best primary representations of Italy
                cuisine as it was. Overall, I believe I achieved what I wanted to showcase, the story of how Italy’s
                foodscape evolved into what it came to be known as, with focus on the factors which incited great
                change. </div>
